# Human Resources Business Analytics

![Status: Complete](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-green)

This project contains a comprehensive **Business Intelligence (BI)** analysis of a company's Human Resources data. The analysis moves beyond simple headcount to diagnose critical organizational challenges, particularly in **talent volatility** and **retention**. The objective is to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to the HR and Leadership teams for strategic workforce planning.

## **Key Strategic Insights**

The analysis of the **2,389 active employee** workforce reveals several high-impact areas requiring executive attention:

* **Critical Labor Volatility:** The company is currently experiencing a **"Leaky Bucket"** problem, with recent rising trends in both hiring (**2,706** hired historically) and terminations (**317** terminated historically). This high churn significantly drives up recruitment and training costs.
* **Sales Attrition Crisis:** While **Operations** has the highest absolute number of terminations (**113**), the **Sales department** exhibits a disproportionately high attrition rate relative to its size. This points to potential systemic issues in compensation, management, or quota setting that require immediate root-cause analysis.
* **Performance Bottleneck:** The majority of the workforce is concentrated at the **"Satisfactory" (50%)** performance level. The most valuable talent segment—high performers—is strongly correlated with the **Bachelor's degree** demographic, highlighting a key talent pipeline that must be proactively nurtured and retained.
* **Departmental Scale:** The **Operations** department is the largest segment of the workforce, with **858** employees, underscoring its criticality and the need for robust staffing.
* **Strategic Compensation Risk:** Roles critical to the business fall into a high-salary, mid-age cluster, making them susceptible to external poaching if internal career progression is not clearly defined.

## **Technical Stack & Methodology**

This project leverages a focused and powerful analytical toolkit for end-to-end data insight.

* **Excel:** Used for initial data preparation, cleaning, and transformation of the raw Human Resources Information System (HRIS) data.
* **Tableau:** The primary tool used for the entire visualization and interactive dashboard creation. This was essential for clearly presenting complex relationships (e.g., Age vs. Salary scatter plot) to stakeholders.
* **Analytical Focus:** The methodology was centered on **diagnostic analysis** (quantifying attrition costs) and **predictive analysis** (identifying high-risk departments).
