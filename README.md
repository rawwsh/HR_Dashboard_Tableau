This project contains a comprehensive business intelligence analysis of a company's Human Resources data.

The goal is to provide actionable insights for strategic HR management, talent acquisition, and employee retention.

### **Key Insights**

* **High Labor Volatility:** The company is experiencing a period of significant turnover, with rising trends in both hiring and termination numbers. This indicates a potential "leaky bucket" problem where aggressive recruitment is being offset by high attrition.
* **Operational Hotspots:** The **Operations** and **Sales** departments are facing the highest termination numbers. The disproportionately high attrition rate in Sales suggests a critical need to investigate management, compensation, and team structure within that department.
* **Performance & Education Gaps:** The core workforce is heavily concentrated at the "Satisfactory" performance level. The analysis reveals that employees with a **Bachelor's degree** are most likely to be high-performers, highlighting a key talent segment to nurture and retain.
* **Strategic Compensation & Retention:** The data reveals distinct salary and age clusters by role. High-value roles like **Software Developer** are compensated for experience, while crucial, high-turnover roles like **HR Coordinator** are in a lower salary bracket, which may contribute to attrition.
